# Project Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive IoT Bike Tracker system with dual operating modes (Testing/Development and Production). The system now includes complete source logic with proper modular architecture.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Dual Mode Operation
- **Testing Mode**: Debug output, serial commands, accelerated timing, test SMS
- **Production Mode**: Minimal logging, normal timing, real emergency contacts

### 2. Enhanced GPS Module (Neo6mGPS)
- Full NMEA sentence parsing (GGA and RMC)
- Real-time location data extraction
- Speed calculation and monitoring
- GPS fix status detection
- Coordinate conversion (DMS to Decimal)

### 3. Advanced GSM Module (Sim800L)
- Network status monitoring
- Signal strength checking
- Reliable SMS transmission
- AT command processing
- Error handling and recovery

### 4. Core Tracker Logic (BikeTrackerCore)
- State management (Initializing, Standby, Tracking, Alert, Error)
- Motion detection algorithms
- Speed monitoring with configurable limits
- Geofencing with breach detection
- Alert system with multiple types
- Battery monitoring
- Emergency SMS notifications

### 5. Complete Main Application (BikeTracker.ino)
- Mode-specific operation handling
- Serial command processing for testing
- Status reporting and diagnostics
- Memory management
